The current object detection system relies solely on the target's HSV values of the target (i.e hue, saturation, value) for identification. It outputs the XYZ coordinates of the target object along the number index of the targets within the frame, colour information and bounding box dimensions (width and height). This method has limitations, particularly in scenarios with varying lighting conditions or where objects have similar colour palettes. The XYZ coordinates are calculated from the centroid of the bounding box around the target, this approach can be susceptible to errors if the target's colour is not uniform or if the object partially blends into the background. To address these limitations and achieve improved overall accuracy, an exploration of the YOLO algorithm is underway. While a custom dataset is being trained for optimal performance with YOLOv5, the recently released YOLO World presents a potential alternative by eliminating the requirement for user-generated training data. However, it is acknowledged that YOLO World's current accuracy is lower than that of previous versions. Therefore, a comparison will be conducted to assess the performance of the HSV-based system, the YOLOv5 model, and YOLO World. This evaluation will consider factors such as accuracy, robustness to lighting variations, and ease of implementation, with the aim of determining the most effective approach.
